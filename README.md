# ✨ The DataViz Challenge - **Transforming EDA Projects into Dashboards**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved transforming an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** into a **fully interactive dashboard** using **Tableau Desktop, Tableau Public, or Power BI**. The goal was to visualize insights from an **Airbnb dataset**, comparing two major cities—**Chicago and New Orleans**—to analyze their Airbnb market performance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In the context of Airbnb operations, **how can data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI** facilitate a **comparative analysis** between **Chicago and New Orleans**?

By leveraging visual analytics, the project aimed to:
1. Uncover key similarities and differences in Airbnb operations.
2. Identify distinctive patterns in Airbnb market performance.
3. Provide valuable insights for business strategy and decision-making.
